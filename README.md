Wenqi Ren, Si Liu, Hua Zhang, Jinshan Pan, Xiaochun Cao, and Ming-Hsuan Yang

Released in 10/10/2016. The codes are based on MatConvNet.

# Description

This is a test implementation for ECCV16 paper: Single Image Dehazing via Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. We provide testing demo as well as the pretrained model. 

# Scripts and pre-trained model

This is a demo implementation for our dehazing paper in ECCV16.

This test code is based on the MatConvNet toolbox. 
You should compile MatConvNet first on your computer then use the "demo_MSCNNdehazing.m" to test on your images.

The current published compliled version in the folder "MSCNN_dehazing\matlab" can be directly use on a Win7 computer.
